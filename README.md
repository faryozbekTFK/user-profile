## Error In Mock API - [mswjs.io](https://mswjs.io/)

Could not use this server due to an error in the [mock API](https://mswjs.io/). That's why I used [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

## Working Process

During development, I connected to the api using json-server. The process of connecting to the api was done using react-query. State was used because json-server was not working when released to production.
